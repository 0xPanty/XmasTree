SCENE: ${randomScene}

STYLE - CRITICAL (This is a POSTCARD ILLUSTRATION, NOT a painting or photo):
- Inspired by classic illustrated postcards by Jenny Nyström, Anton Pieck, and Ellen Clapsaddle
- FLAT illustration style with simplified forms and shapes
- Hand-drawn look with visible pen/ink linework
- Watercolor-like soft color washes, NOT oil painting texture
- Muted vintage colors: dusty red, sage green, mustard yellow, cream, soft brown
- Simple shading with limited color palette (4-6 main colors)
- Vintage paper texture with subtle grain
- Slight sepia tone or aged paper effect

CHARACTER from reference photo:
- Preserve general facial features and hair style
- Simplify to illustration form (not photorealistic)
- Classic timeless winter clothing appropriate for the scene
- International/universal style (not overly American)

SCENE COMPOSITION:
- Festive winter atmosphere: snow, decorated trees, warm lights
- Cozy, joyful, nostalgic holiday mood
- Clear focal point with simple background elements
- Vertical 9:16 format like traditional postcards

AVOID:
- Oil painting texture or realistic brush strokes
- Photorealistic rendering
- Modern digital art look
- Overly detailed or busy composition
- Dark or dramatic lighting

Think: Classic vintage greeting card from 1920s-1950s European tradition.

Scene: ${randomScene}

Festive winter scene, snowy fairy-tale forest, decorated Christmas tree with warm glowing lights.
Timeless vintage winter clothing, classic international postcard style.
Cozy, joyful, nostalgic holiday mood.
Hand-painted illustration look, muted colors, subtle vintage paper texture.

- The scene should fade gently into the cream/beige background like watercolor bleeding into paper
- NO defined oval or arched border shape - just natural, organic fading
- Edges should have soft, irregular watercolor wash effect
- Think: watercolor painting on cream paper where the colors naturally fade and blend at the edges
- The transition should be so smooth and natural that there's no visible "frame" or "border line"
- Vary the fade distance - some areas can fade sooner, some later (organic, not uniform)
- NO text, NO words, NO captions in the image

Think: Watercolor illustration that naturally bleeds into the paper background, NOT a framed picture with defined edges.

IMPORTANT: Natural watercolor fade effect - NO hard edges, NO defined oval/arch shapes, just gentle color blending.`;

"Dear Sarah, Merry Christmas! I wanted to share what I've been up to this holiday season. Every evening, I've been heading to the town square where the most magnificent Christmas tree stands tall, adorned with hundreds of twinkling golden lights that dance in the winter breeze. The air is crisp and filled with the joyful sounds of carol singers, and there's always the warm, comforting aroma of hot cocoa and roasted chestnuts wafting from the festive market stalls.

I've been ice skating on the outdoor rink with friends, laughing as we slip and slide across the frozen surface. The whole scene feels like something out of a storybook, with snow gently falling and children building snowmen nearby. It's these simple, magical moments that make this season so special.

I find myself thinking of you during these celebrations and wishing you could be here to experience this festive atmosphere with me. I hope your holidays are filled with equal warmth and joy!

Warmest wishes, John"
